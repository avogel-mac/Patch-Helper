## Patch Helper
A script that serves to display to the user all available updates for the affected device in a dialogue.

## What does it do?
The script consolidates the various update notifications and generates a single window for the user that:

_- Informs about the number of updates available_

_- Lists which applications will be updated_

_- Provides the count of available postponements_

_- Specifies how frequently the dialogue restarts._

The user will be informed about which applications are currently being updated and also about the results.
